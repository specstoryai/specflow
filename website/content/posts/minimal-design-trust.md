When the page is quiet, the ideas feel louder. Minimal design removes friction and lets readers focus on the argument.

## The interface should disappear

Technical writing already asks for attention. If the layout competes with the message, the reader hesitates. A calm page signals confidence.

## Soft contrast is a signal

Warm neutrals and consistent spacing communicate restraint. That restraint tells readers the author has done the hard work of editing.

## The payoff

A minimal interface gives your writing authority. It tells readers the ideas are strong enough to stand on their own.
