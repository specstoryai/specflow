Most teams lose time because they start building before they understand the constraints. The first 30 minutes should feel quiet and deliberate.

## Minute 0–10: define the boundary

Write down what is in scope and what is explicitly out. This is the moment to protect the project from silent scope creep.

## Minute 10–20: clarify the artifact

Name the deliverable you will ship today: a post template, a landing page, or a working prototype. A clear artifact changes the quality of output.

## Minute 20–30: draft the handoff

End the session by writing a handoff note. It should fit on five lines and include the next action. If you can hand it to a new agent and they can continue, you are ready to build.
