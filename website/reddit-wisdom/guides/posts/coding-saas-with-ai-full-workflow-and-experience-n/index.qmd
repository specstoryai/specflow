## Post Content

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience as a non-tech solopreneur coding my SaaS project using ChatGPT and other AI tools. I launched the MVP in one month, and in two months, I already had some paying customers. That's not bad for a product with almost zero production costs.

**The product**

AI assistant builder where you can create chatbots to handle initial contacts and conduct in-depth interviews. 8D-1 asks follow-up questions, so you get comprehensive answers and can jump into the conversation when needed. If you want to try it, use the promo code **REDDITOR** to get 100 free messages.

I know everyone hates posts with promotions, but this project is incredibly important to me. Even if 8D-1 isn’t for you, I’d love for you to give it a try.

**Background and Motivation**

I have a decade of product manager experience and have founded several startups (mostly commercial disasters). However, I was never the tech guy. I’m that creative type of product manager who developers often see as a mix between Andy Warhol and a piece of furniture. So I’m 100% not a developer.

**How did I start GPT coding?**

At first, I just asked GPT to explain some code to me. Then I started asking it to correct small parts of business logic. Eventually, I began experimenting with simple Python scripts for repetitive tasks and finally tried building basic full-stack web applications.

**My AI Toolkit**

1. GPT-4/4o: My go-to for generating new code, brainstorming architecture, and technical solutions. It’s slow and has its bad days, but I’ve adapted to its quirks. I use a custom GPT model with presets, named after my first CTO.
1. GPT-3.5: For simpler tasks and when I hit GPT-4’s limits. It’s faster and helps with terminal requests and Git management.
1. Anthropic: A backup when GPT-4 is stuck. I use it sparingly due to the cost through my developer account.
1. GitHub Copilot in VSCode: My most-used tool. Select the code, get what I need. Not the smartest, but incredibly helpful.
1. GitHub In-line Copilot: I can’t imagine coding without it now.

**How AI Changed My Development Process**

1. No Design Phase: I don’t need to explain my ideas to anyone else. I use Figma just to create assets.
1. Git is Useless: A single-user approach would be more user-friendly for solo projects.
1. Backlog is Bullshit: I keep a task list and a general idea of what needs to be done.
1. Creative Process: This is 100% a creative process from an engineering and conceptual standpoint.
1. Isolation: I’ve become totally unsocialized. I rarely interact with others, which affects my communication skills and limits business opportunities.
1. Identity Crisis: Sometimes I feel like neither a product manager nor a pro developer. If my projects fail, I worry about finding a normal job.

**My Workflow and Stack**

I start with Python to develop general business logic. I like Python because it's intuitive and GPT works perfectly with it. I use a microservice architecture, breaking the code into small pieces. This helps because ChatGPT loses context if the code is too large. My Python backend consists of around 20 interconnected modules with 2-15 standalone functions each.

[Python Backend is a bit messy](https://preview.redd.it/nwamlakp0z5d1.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e741a9f8aed2d65cb0d882d3e04b1bcaf1325f3)

Another important part of my setup is Strapi, a CMS I use for user-friendly database management and API. It's super user-friendly and free. In my setup, Strapi is the single source of truth, acting as a middleman between the backend and frontend and managing user access.

On the frontend, I use Vue.js. As I didn't know any frontend language, I tried Next, React, Angular, and finally decided that Vue is a bit more intuitive for me. For each framework, I looked for templates and boilerplates. For Vue, I recommend Vulk by CSS Ninja – a really good set of components.

Payments: Stripe. Mailing service: reSend.

**Infrastructure struggle**

Going into production was tricky. While everything seemed to work on localhost, deploying it was a different story. I spent almost three weeks figuring out how to deploy everything, which was very stressful. I HATE CORS!

I can only say that I tried Vercel, Digital Ocean, Fly, Heroku. And everytime there were some problems. I don’t want to go deeper in this topic, but it seems like the next wave of internet needs some simple hosting platform for GPT Coders.

**Plans**

While I was never into coding before, now I love it so much. I can spend hours fixing bugs and adding new ones.

I'm still trying to figure out if I want to hire real developers to help me with some quality issues. Probably, I'll wait for some traction first. But as far as I can see, 8D-1 is more than alive. I personally use it to handle incoming inquiries on LinkedIn.

[Using my own creation](https://preview.redd.it/km4bwfbf1z5d1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=b139b493bcbd9f0e47ffc78af05391e1bfd4a58a)

I really hope this project will help me pay my bills. For $3k MRR, which is my current goal, I need around 200 paying customers. That seems doable, but wish me luck!
