## Post Content

Over time, I’ve developed a structured, session-based workflow that helps me get the most out of Cursor. It’s designed to maintain focus, optimize context usage, and support continuous improvement.

### Planning Process

I start with a high-level planning document that outlines the entire project. This document evolves over time: early tasks are fleshed out with detailed steps, while long-term items remain flexible and lightweight.

Cursor agents generate tasks from this outline using **task atomicity**—breaking work into small, focused units that each solve a single problem. This approach lets me complete most tasks within 1–2 focused sessions.

Atomic tasks help optimize context usage: they contain just enough information for the agent to act effectively without overloading the context window, reducing the chances of hallucination or scope drift.

### Session-Based Development

I organize my workflow around **focused sessions**. Each session has a narrow scope and time limit, which has dramatically improved the quality of outputs since I started using Cursor.

I follow an **adaptive planning** philosophy: I only plan 2–3 tasks ahead and revise frequently based on discoveries or blockers. Session insights often feed directly back into the planning doc.

### Starting a Session

At the beginning of a session, I tell the agent I want to start working. It loads the project context, reviews the current state, and identifies any pending improvements or relevant blockers. From there, it sets a clear initial focus.

Each task tracks its **prerequisites and dependencies**, allowing the agent to optimize task order and flag anything that's currently blocked.

The agent stays explicitly focused on the task at hand throughout the session. This minimizes scope creep and enforces a clear boundary between **planning** and **execution**. If new ideas or features arise, I ask the agent to create a new task rather than shifting focus mid-session.

### Ending a Session

I usually end a session once a task is complete. However, if a task results in heavy file changes or complex edits, I may initiate a "save" and split the remainder into a new session.

To save, I use the [Aegis save command](https://buildsomething.ai/aegis/quick-start/basic-commands/#save-progress). This triggers the agent to:

- Log the session,
- Record key decisions,
- Update task progress,
- Generate improvement insights.

### Task Lifecycle

Tasks flow through these states: **Planned → Active (or Hold) → Completed**. The agent naturally moves tasks between these states and updates their metadata accordingly.

Each task contains structured front matter with fields like:

- Title + unique ID
- Status
- Priority
- Dependencies
- Timestamps (created/updated)
- Memory type
- Progress tracking

Optional fields (e.g. tags, assignee) can be added as needed.

The task description establishes shared understanding, the objectives define success criteria, and the steps provide actionable guidance. The progress section is continuously updated, with agent-generated notes or insights recorded for future reference.

I treat each task as a **focused, self-contained conversation**. This setup ensures that both I and the agent stay aligned on what needs to be done, without overwhelming the context window.

### Continuous Improvement

The agent passively tracks how time is spent, which tasks get blocked, and what decisions are made. It then suggests **process improvements**, surfacing efficiency gains for future sessions.

This workflow has radically improved how I collaborate with Cursor. It keeps things modular, focused, and adaptable—making it easier to trust the agent as a co-developer, not just a code assistant.

This whole workflow is powered by a lightweight framework I built called [Aegis](https://github.com/BuildSomethingAI/aegis-framework). It helps structure tasks, planning, and session logs in a way that plays nicely with AI agents like Cursor—without adding friction to the creative flow.

Happy to answer questions or hear how others approach this!
