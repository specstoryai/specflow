## Post Content

After a long day fighting with Cursor flaking out on a massive monolithic script I hadn’t decomposed yet, I kept seeing it drop code blocks, delete whole files, and struggle to make \_bak files to prevent regressions.

Eventually, I hit a wall. The backups it was generating weren’t consistent. It was restoring old work we’d already revised past. Context was getting scrambled. I was getting frustrated.

So I tried one last thing:

>I told Cursor to **explicitly make a backup** before and after each task.

>As it started churning through planning and ramping up for the task… I saw something weird:

It made a **Git commit**. On its own. Directly to the repo.  
  
I thought:

>“If Cursor is already committing, why don’t I **track those commit SHAs** right inside my .cursor/manifest.md (or workflow\_state.md) alongside each task?”

  
**But why Aaron?! Why track the GitSHA's?**

For point in time reference silly! Point 👏 in 👏 time 👏 reference!   
  
Not just for *you* to roll back. For **the AI** to *understand*, compare, and rebase context like a goddamn memory surgeon. By embedding GitSHAs directly into the manifest beside each task, I’m not just tracking what got done, I’m anchoring it in time. Now when a feature fails or needs to be revisited, I don’t guess, no Cmd + Z panic hoping I get back to the right state after hours of work. I jump straight to the SHA from the last working phase, see exactly what was there, and tell the AI to pick up from that moment. The manifest becomes a timeline, not just a checklist, a versioned record of intent that both I and the AI can navigate like a map.

  
Example Manifest with SHA's

    ## Task: Add Auth0 Login Flow
    
    - [x] Install SDK  
      - GITSHA: `abc1234`
    - [x] Build login form  
      - GITSHA: `def5678`
    - [ ] Integrate backend session

Project Settings Rules

    - Always track GITSHA after every meaningful task completion.
    - Add it to the manifest as a Phase Checkpoint.
    - Reference these SHAs when debugging, testing, or asking AI to resume from previous states.
